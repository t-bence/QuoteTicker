The code uses some elements of (this)[https://lastminuteengineers.com/creating-esp8266-web-server-arduino-ide/] and (this)[https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/8x8-led-matrix-max7219-tutorial-scrolling-text-android-control-via-bluetooth/] tutorial.  
Also, (Riyas's MAX7219){https://github.com/riyas-org/max7219} library is used to drive the LED matrix.  
Parts of the (Skeleton CSS toolkit)[http://getskeleton.com/] are used, as well.
